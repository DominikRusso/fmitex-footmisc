	* footmisc.dtx:
	Corrected the "bottom" option so that it behaves like in v5. Dropped
	"bottomfootnotes", because everything can be expressed with combinations
	of the four options "bottom" (footnotes at the bottom), "bottomfloats",
	"abovefloats", and "belowfloats". (gh/1)

	* footmisc.dtx:
	Previous version was 5.5b from 2011. This is now version 6.
	A few bugs have been fixed and the following new options have
	been added:

	  - bottomfloats
	  - bottomfootnotes
	  - abovefloats
	  - belowfloats

	For details see the package documentation.

	There is a rollback possibility using either a date
	'[=YYYY-MM-DD]' or the string '[=v5]' as the second optional
	argument to \usepackage, e.g., \usepackage{footmisc}[=v5].
