	* footmisc.dtx:
	Previous version was 5.5b from 2011. This is now version 6.
	A few bugs have been fixed and the following new options have
	been added:

	  - bottomfloats
	  - bottomfootnotes
	  - abovefloats
	  - belowfloats

	For details see the package documentation.

	There is a rollback possibility using either a date
	'[=YYYY-MM-DD]' or the string '[=v5]' as the second optional
	argument to \usepackage, e.g., \usepackage{footmisc}[=v5].
